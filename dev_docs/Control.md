## TODO

#### general

* should implement some common functionality
  * increase (cyclic, bound)
  * decrease (cyclic, bound)
  *

#### Control.Simple

* just a wrapper for `Reactive.Signal`
* (almost?) everything should be mapped to this by default

## Control.HotKey

* takes key (hopefully in a nicer way than GLFW.KEY_Z)
* takes function to execute on key press

## GUI elements

I haven't worked with these yet
