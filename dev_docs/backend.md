###### 2D camera

For Plotting
* Coordinate Systems
  * Plotting Coordinates, i.e. those initialized by Coord.Cartesian
  * [0, 1]x[0, 1] coordinates (for relative scales)
  * screen coordinates (pixels) (1)
* matrices
  * view: rotations, positioning, zoom
  * projection = identity?
  * projectionview = projection * view
* Controls:
  * position (x, y) by left click drag
  * zoom (z) by mouse wheel, maybe right click box select?
  * maybe rotation (around z) by CTRL + left click drag?

For Axes and other static things (2)
* use [0, 1]x[0, 1] coordinates as base coordinate system
  * i.e. plotting coordinates exist and update, but they don't affect view or projection. Controls should also noch change these matrices (except rotation, probably)


Notes:
* (-) See also: GLAbstraction.GLCamera (and .MatrixMath)
* (1) Screen Coordinates are generated by GLVisualize at some point.
* (2) This could also be a second set of view, projection and projectionview matrices in a camera
* (-) Figure out how 'share' information between cameras, i.e. mouse and key events, zoom, pan, rotation


###### 3D Camera

* seperate rotation from panning, zoom, projection (matrices or different cameras)
  * this will make it easy to apply specific rotations to seperate objects (e.g. have a Cube-Point always face the camera)
* ...


###### Window/Screen

* setup general root screen
* setup child screen/s for drawing
  * This should make it easier to later partition the screen (add subplots)
  * alternatively, we could handle these with cameras
* figure out how to add custom cameras with keys other than `:custom`

Notes:
* (0) See also: GLWindow.screen, GLVisualize.renderloop
